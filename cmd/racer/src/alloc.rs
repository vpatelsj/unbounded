//! The allocator: page placement, IO, and the cross-core hops into shard state.
//!
//! Durable formats live in `layout.rs`, the decisions in `shard.rs`. One `Shard` per
//! worker core, no locks, no atomics, no background threads. A page is placed by a
//! free-list pop, written out of place, and its metadata rides a group-committed 4 KiB
//! mblock write. `Small` (4 KiB) carries a CRC in its mblock entry, verified on every
//! read; a page that does not match is never served. `Huge` (4 MiB) carries none, so
//! ordering is its only defence against a torn or lost data write. Both write data
//! before the entry naming it; `finish_small` gives the small class's own reason.
//! Policy lives elsewhere: anti-entropy in `heal.rs`, CASPaxos in `paxos.rs`.
