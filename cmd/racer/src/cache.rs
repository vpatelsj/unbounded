//! Cooperative caching: which nodes keep a copy of which page, so reads of a hot page
//! do not all land on the three that own it.
//!
//! No consistency of its own. Every cached read is confirmed by the mandatory metadata
//! round, so staleness is self-correcting and there is no invalidation protocol. Never
//! a correctness dependency: every entry point may decline, at the cost of one ordinary
//! read.
//!
//! Three properties keep this file small:
//!
//!   * **No directory.** Placement is a rendezvous hash over the reader's own cohort,
//!     so any reader computes the replica set locally.
//!   * **No per-key state.** Hotness is a count-min sketch, width is arithmetic on it,
//!     and the reader's width hint is a direct-mapped byte array. Nothing grows with
//!     the key space and nothing allocates after `open`.
//!   * **No durability.** The map is volatile, writes are in place and `Buffered`, and
//!     the region is carved at format time. A torn cache page is unreachable after a
//!     restart because nothing points at it, so the allocator's out-of-place discipline
//!     does not apply here.
//!
//! Choices worth naming:
//!
//!   * The rendezvous hash is [`config::mix`]. It is never on the wire; only local
//!     computability and `R(k,w) ⊂ R(k,w+1)` matter.
//!   * A shedding replica answers `MISSING` rather than a busy status of its own, since
//!     only four errnos survive nvmet. The reader's fallback is identical either way.
//!   * `τ` is requests per decay interval, not an IOPS rate: it is clamped to the
//!     sketch's ceiling of 15 per interval, so an IOPS-scale value yields `w ≤ 1`.
