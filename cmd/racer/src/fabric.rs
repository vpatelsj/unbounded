//! Node-to-node transport: a stateless codec and nothing else.
//!
//! A logical operation becomes a plain NVMe read or write against a peer's namespace,
//! because read and write are the only verbs nvme-of gives us. No session, no sequence
//! number, no per-operation memory beyond the in-flight SQE: everything an operation
//! needs is in the LBA or in a 4 KiB trailer beside the payload. Retries, quorum,
//! caching and placement live above this file.
//!
//! The trick is that **the LBA is the RPC**. A read whose LBA encodes `(GET, addr)`
//! returns the page, DMA'd straight into the initiator's registered buffer; a write
//! encoding `(TRIM, addr)` returns only a status. The initiator drives everything, so
//! anything needing a rich reply has to be a read.
//!
//! # What the kernel forces
//!
//! 1. **Two address regions, not sub-frames.** `imm` sits inside the frame id, so
//!    `imm`-selected sub-frames of a 4 MiB page would land at unrelated LBAs. Each
//!    region has its own stride instead: one command goes out, the nvme layer splits it
//!    at the peer's MDTS, and the target reassembles by LBA offset.
//! 2. **48-bit frame ids.** A frame id times its stride is a byte offset, which must
//!    fit `loff_t`.
//! 3. **Four statuses.** The nvmet target erases the rest to `EIO`; see [`status`].
//! 4. **Relaying is a flag, not an opcode.** A read carries no data *to* the target, so
//!    an inner frame cannot ride an outer one's trailer — and the motivating case,
//!    relaying a metadata read, is a read. The outer frame *is* the inner frame; see
//!    [`HOPS`].
//! 5. **Gather copies the 4 KiB payload.** `ReadvFixed`/`WritevFixed` take a *single*
//!    `buf_index`, so a guest's ublk page and a pooled trailer cannot share one vectored
//!    fixed SQE; gather is instead one contiguous registered buffer of page plus
//!    trailer. Still one command and one round trip, and the device path already stages
//!    every 4 KiB page through a pool buffer. 4 MiB pages never gather, and stay zero
//!    copy.
//! 6. **One entry point.** Direction follows the opcode and shape follows the length, so
//!    the client API is [`Link::send`] plus [`Frame::decode`]; what a frame *means* is
//!    decided above this file.

/// The status alphabet, as it survives the wire.

/// The `ublk -> BLK_STS_* -> NVMe status -> nvme initiator -> errno` pipeline preserves
/// **four** values. The narrow point is nvmet's `blk_to_nvme_status()`, which has arms
/// for exactly `BLK_STS_{NOSPC,TARGET,NOTSUPP,MEDIUM}` and sends the rest as
/// `NVME_SC_INTERNAL`, which the initiator's `nvme_error_status()` turns back into
/// `EIO`. So `EBADE`, `EILSEQ`, `EAGAIN`, `ENOLINK`, `EINVAL` all arrive as a bare
/// `EIO`, which the rule "any unrecognised status is a transport failure" escalates
/// into a spurious path failover.
