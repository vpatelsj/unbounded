//! Anti-entropy: per-group digests over this node's registers, the wire encoding of the
//! three group-addressed control ops, and the sweep that drives them.
//!
//! Join replay and periodic digest exchange are one mechanism: enumerate a group's
//! registers and hand the differences to `paxos::repair`.
//!
//! The stream carries no page bytes. A cursor emits `(addr, version, ballot)` and the
//! receiver pulls the page with an ordinary `GET`, as `LEARN` already does. So there is
//! no second data path, no CRC to re-verify in transit (the `GET` verifies at the
//! source), and a page that changes mid-stream arrives as a newer value rather than a
//! torn one.
//!
//! The "tree" is one flat level of 512 buckets: 512 digests are exactly one 4 KiB
//! trailer, and a root would only add a round trip.
