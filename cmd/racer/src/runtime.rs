//! Racer runtime: ublk block devices served by one io_uring worker per physical core.
//!
//! Resources are declared, never opened ad hoc: [`Runtime::reload`] hands you a
//! [`Configurator`] and you build your config out of the handles it returns, which stay
//! registered on every worker until that config is retired. Holding a [`Disk`] is the
//! proof that it is registered, so IO cannot name a file the kernel does not know about.
//!
//! Under the `sim` feature the kernel seams are replaced by `sim`: no ublk device is
//! ever created, a [`Disk`] names a simulated one, and the tables below shrink.
