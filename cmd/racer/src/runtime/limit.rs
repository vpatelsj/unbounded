//! A rate limiter for a single device, metering operations and bytes at once.
//!
//! The limiter is a governor, not a safety net: set below what the device will take,
//! because pacing ourselves costs a bounded wait while overshooting costs an unbounded
//! one applied to whichever IO is in flight. Operations and bytes per second are metered
//! independently since either can bind first, and an IO waits for the later.
//!
//! Each resource has a virtual clock holding the time at which the budget spent so far
//! will have been earned back. An arrival takes the clock as its slot and pushes it out
//! by its cost, so slots go out in arrival order with no queue and no starvation. `admit`
//! never sleeps: it returns the wait, so it serves both the async runtime (a timer op)
//! and the startup threads (`thread::sleep`).
