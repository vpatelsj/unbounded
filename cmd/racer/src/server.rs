//! Maps ublk requests onto allocator pages.
//!
//! The runtime sizes each device so one request is at most one page and never straddles
//! two, and the allocator owns placement, versioning and integrity. What is left is
//! address arithmetic and two rules: a hole reads as zeroes (the block layer's), and a
//! 4 MiB page is written whole or not at all (out-of-place placement's).
//!
//! A node exports a volume per config entry, which consumers mount, and one *fabric*
//! device, which peers issue against. Both use the same per-core workers and the same
//! zero-copy path; they differ only in the LBA. On a volume it is an offset; on the
//! fabric device it is the request itself.
