//! Deterministic simulation.
//!
//! The whole cluster runs in one thread. Every node is a real worker — same op slab,
//! pool and hop fabric — with only the kernel seams replaced: disk submission, the
//! timer, the clock, raw device IO and the guest copy. `server`, `paxos`, `alloc`,
//! `cache`, `heal` and `fabric` run unmodified above that line.
//!
//! Two substitutions carry the design. A device is a sparse block map, so a node's
//! store and its handle on a peer are the same kind of object. A buffer is ordinary
//! process memory, so a transfer is a memcpy the simulator does by address.
