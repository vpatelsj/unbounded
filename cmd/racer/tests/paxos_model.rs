//! Model checks for four state machines that are not obviously correct by inspection:
//! the guarded one-shot accept with its prepare and repair fallback, when the

//! memberships, and the anti-entropy sweep healing needs (`heal.rs`).
//!
//! Every mechanism under test is a parameter, so the checks come in pairs: the rule the
//! implementation uses must hold, the simpler rule it replaced must fail. A model that
