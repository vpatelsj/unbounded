// Package racerctrl derives, validates and installs the RACER dataplane's node
// configuration.
//
// The dataplane in cmd/racer knows nothing but the file it is handed: no
// discovery, no membership protocol, no NVMe-oF, no Kubernetes. Everything it
// does is a function of that file, and the only feedback it offers is a
// Prometheus endpoint. This package is the half that decides what goes in the
// file.
//
// The split of responsibility is deliberate. Cluster-scoped state - universe
// ids, extent ids, address-space placement, catalog membership, epoch cursors -
// is agreed by exactly one writer, the unbounded-operator, and published on
// StorageClass and PersistentVolume annotations. Node-scoped state - a node's
// id, cohort, store footprint, exported devices and scraped health - lives on
// that node's own Node annotations and is written only by that node's agent.
// Derivation is then a pure function of those two, so every node reaches the
// same answer without talking to any other node.
