// A racer zone is a failure domain, a single catalog and a single anti-entropy
// domain. An operator may name one per node and that always wins, but naming a
// zone for every node in a thousand-node cluster is not a thing anyone wants to
// do, so this file works one out.
//
// Everything here is pure. It reads the cursors and a census of what is already
// placed, and returns the zone and cohort one node should take; the caller
// commits the mutated cursors before it stamps the node, so a crash between the
// two leaks a zone id rather than placing a node twice. Zone ids were never
// reusable, so a leaked one costs nothing but a slot in the 64 a universe may
// name.

	// label. Empty for a node that declares none, which costs it the guarantee
	// that its trios span three of them.
